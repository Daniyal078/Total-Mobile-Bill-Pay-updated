            Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to
            understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. We use your

            We will collect and use personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes
            specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned
            or as required by law.

        </p>


        <h5 class="fw-bold my-2">Electronic Communication</h5>
        <p>When you use our Website, we automatically collect certain computer information by the interaction of your
            mobile phone or web browser with our Website. Such information is typically considered Non-Personal
            Information. We also collect the following:
        </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold my-2">Cookies</h5>
        <p>Our Website uses “Cookies” to identify the areas of our Website that you have visited. A Cookie is a small
            piece of data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to personalize
            the Content that you see on our Website. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of Cookies.
            However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access functionality on our Website correctly or at
            all. We never place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.
        </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold my-2">Geographical Information</h5>
        <p>When you use the mobile application, we may use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine
            your current location in order to determine the city you are located in and display information with
            relevant data or advertisements. We will not share your current location with other users or partners. If
            you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location
            services for the mobile application located in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings and/or
            within the mobile application.
        </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold my-2">Automatic Information</h5>
        <p>We automatically receive information from your web browser or mobile device. This information includes the
            name of the website from which you entered our Website, if any, as well as the name of the website to which
            you’re headed when you leave our website. This information also includes the IP address of your
            computer/proxy server that you use to access the Internet, your Internet Website provider name, web browser
            type, type of mobile device, and computer operating system. We use all of this information to analyze trends
            among our Users to help improve our Website.
        </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold my-2">Log Data</h5>
        <p>Like many Website operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website
            (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”)
            address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Website that you visit, the time and date of your
            visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics. Under the Child’s Online Privacy Security Act, no
            Website operator can require, as a condition to involvement in an activity, that a child younger than 13
            years of age divulge more details than is reasonably required. TR Technologies LLC. abides by this demand.
            TR Technologies LLC. just collects information willingly offered; no information is gathered passively.
            children under 13 can submit only their email address when sending us an email in our “Contact Us” area. TR
            Technologies LLC. makes use of the email address to respond to a one-time demand from a child under 13 and
            afterwards deletes the email address. In case TR Technologies LLC. collects and maintains personal
            information relating to a child under 13, the parent may send out an email to us to review, alter and/or
            erase such info as well as to decline to enable any additional collection or use of the child’s information.
        </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold my-2">How We Use Your Information</h5>
        <p>We use the information we receive from you as follows:

        </p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold my-2">Security</h5>
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over
            the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We utilize
            practical protection measures to safeguard against the loss, abuse, and modification of the individual Data
            under our control. Personal Data is kept in a secured database and always sent out by means of an encrypted
            SSL method when supported by your web browser. No Web or email transmission is ever totally protected or
            mistake cost-free. For example, email sent out to or from the Website may not be protected. You must take
            unique care in deciding what info you send to us by means of email.
